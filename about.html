                        <p>I'm a 16-year-old Homeschooled teen who loves creating, designing and building websites. I also really like to read anything fiction really.<br><br> 
                            
                            My website building started when my dad wanted to start his website where he sells online courses for kids and teens YoungCre8ors.com, so my dad and I looked at different website-building options.<br>We tried at least three or four different ones, but we found that all of them were not what we were looking for (thay all lacked customisation.)<br><br>My dad didn't have time to look at another option, so I said I'd look at WordPress for him, and I ended up building him a WordPress site. I noticed how much I liked building websites, and have built a few more since then.
                        <br><br>I also really enjoy graphic design which is great because I can combine the two and design graphics for the websites I build.</p>
